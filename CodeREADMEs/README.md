# What is a Code README?

A code README is a markdown text document that describes the contents, use, and code of a code repository. 

On many code sharing platforms, a `README.md` file in a folder will have the markdown text styling in the document rendered as HTML on the repository's webpage. If you are reading this document on `https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/README-Templates/tree/main/CodeREADMEs`, you are reading a rendered version of the `README-Templates/CodeREADMEs/README.md` text file. 

# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple document styling format, with conventions for creating **bold**, *italicized*, `code`, and many other styles of text without needing a binary file like Word .docx, or difficult style tags like `<html>`.
