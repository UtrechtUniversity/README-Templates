# README-Templates
A collection of README templates from around the UU and other institutions. 

## Purpose 

In order to help researchers document their code, we (the data stewards in the faculty of Geosciences) created a repository with resources on how to create README files for in a data package and for on code sharing platforms such as GitHub. 

## Layout

There are currently two subdirectories of this repository, FilesystemREADMEs and CodeREADMEs. 

* `FilessystemREADMEs` is for README.txt style files that should accompany data packages on the file system or in archives. 
* `CodeREADMEs` is for README.md style markdown files that should be included with code in Git repositories to help users read documentation more easily online. 

In each of these folders there is a README.md file that will explain more about each folder, and each of these two directories will be split between UU and External templates.
