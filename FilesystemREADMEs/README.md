## What is a Filesystem README?

A filesystem README is a basic text file that sits on the filesystem and accompanys datasets. Filesystem READMEs should include information on the contents of a data package or data set, description of the dataset, how it was created, what terms and conventions are used, quality control procedures, file formats, software required, and any other relevant information to the data.
